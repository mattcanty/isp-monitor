# ISP Monitor

Monitor your internet service provider.

This works... but the ease of running is still work-in-progress. If you know
what you are doing and can read the code, go ahead. I'll be making it easier
to get set up soon.

## My Setup

I have `isp-monitor` running on a Raspeberry Pi which has a wired connection
directly into the router. I created a 2nd worksheet on the Google Sheet so that
I could translate some of the data into something more digestible.
